## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars }
summary(cars)
summary(sleep)
```
<br>

```{r cars2 , echo=FALSE}
summary(cars)
summary(sleep)

```

<br>

## This is an example of an inline code
# Insert R code directly into text, which will be replaced by its output when rendered.


The mean value for the extra variable for the Sleep data set is  `r mean(sleep$extra)`

<br>
<br>
<br>

$$
\hat{\mathbf{\beta}} = (\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{X})^{-1}\mathbf{X}^T\mathbf{y}
$$

$$mean(X) = \frac{\sum\_{i=1}^nX}{n}$$ 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:





```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)

setwd("F:/Meetup/Rmarkdown/")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
